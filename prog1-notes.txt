We can construct the search tree implicitly using a node class.

Node{
State current
Node parent
String action taken to enter this state
Int cost of entering this state}

How to do the search:

create start state
frontier = {start}
while(true):
	if frontier is empty, return "fail"
current = frontier.pop()
if current.isGoal() return "success"
for each legal action in current state:
	frontier.add(new Node with current state expanded);

This finds a goal node, and the path taken to that goal node is the solution.
